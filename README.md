> This a search app to create a realtime search box, where users search articles, and then to have analytics that display what users were searching for. You can also track via IP - no need to create a devise, etc. The main goal is to record their input in realtime and ultimately display analytics & trends on what people are searching for the most. (this is not about search itself, but really about analytics behind it).
